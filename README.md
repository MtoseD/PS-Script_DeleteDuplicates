# PS-Script_DeleteDuplicates
In this repo you'll find two PowerShell scripts, one to write down files that exist twice and another one to delete these.

Here you can see that the _mountain.png_ and the _porsche.png_ file are present in their subfolders (cars/landscapes) but also in the main folder _photos_. So there you have two duplicates. You can now use the two scripts I mentioned above to delete the ones in the main folder.
